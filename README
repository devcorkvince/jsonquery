JSONQuery provides a comprehensive set of data querying tools including 
filtering, recursive search, sorting, mapping, range selection, and flexible 
expressions with wildcard string comparisons and various operators.

Quick Examples:
		var data = {customers:[
			{name:"Susan", purchases:29},
			{name:"Kim", purchases:150}, 
			{name:"Jake", purchases:27}
		]};
		
		var results = JSONQuery("$.customers[?purchases > 21 & name='Jake'][\\purchases]",data);
		results 
		
		returns customers sorted by higest number of purchases to lowest.
